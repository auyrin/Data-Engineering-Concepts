# Overview
Learn about Data Engineering with me. we'll go through some key concepts; you'll study those
concepts on your own, and then you'll test your knowledge with the assignments I provide here.
I encourage you to try them on your own before looking at my solutions.

# data modeling
**prerequisites**: data-warehousing, relational-databases, noSQL(mongoDB)
**Use**: data modeling is the foundation for building efficient, maintainable, and scalable data systems. in other words, it's a critical concept for data engineering.
**how to proceed**: learn about the prerequisites if you haven't already. attempt the first assignment on your own. check it's solution. rinse-repeat
